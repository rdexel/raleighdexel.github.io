          <h1>About Me.</h1>
          <p>
            Hello, my name is Raleigh Dexel. I’m currently a sophomore college
            student studying business with hopes to someday develop my own tech
            startup. I graduated from Olympia High School at the age of 16 which
            has led me to where I am now, a 17-year-old college sophomore at
            South Puget Sound Community College. This year, I plan to earn my
            Associate’s in Business before transferring to a four-year
            university to continue my studies of business administration and
            computer science. <br />
            entrepreneurial spirit has been part of my identity for as long as I
            can remember, and the ambitious goal of creating a startup has
            inspired me to learn everything I can about the subjects of
            business, technology, design, and innovation. Whether it’s web
            design, cryptocurrency, programming, or investing, I’m always trying
            to involve myself with new and unfamiliar projects. As I continue to
            develop my programming skills, immerse myself in the world of
            business, and expand my personal network, I am confident that I will
            be able to fulfill my ambition of creating an influential startup.
            <br />
            I appreciate your interest in my personal journey and I encourage
            you to explore other parts of the website or get in touch with me!
