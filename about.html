          <h1>About Me.</h1>
          <p>
            Hello, my name is Raleigh Dexe! I’m a college studying business with
            hopes to someday create a disruptive company that positively affects
            millions of people. My entrepreneurial spirit has been part of my
            identity for as long as I can remember, and it all started when I
            was in 5th selling novelty cards at local craft fairs. I would
            create small watercolor paintings using my artistic abilities, copy
            those paintings, and manually place them on small cards. While they
            were tedious to make, I always enjoyed the process and I sold out
            almost every time. As my artistic interest transitioned to
            photography, I became obsessed with drones and aerial photography.
            After saving up my money and purchasing my first drone, I got in
            touch with some local real estate agents. This led to my second
            business, Dexel Aerial Photography, which allowed me to offer my
            services as an aerial property photographer and build connections
            that will last a lifetime. Over the past couple of years, I have
            become increasingly interested in technology, computers, and the
            web. Using my web design skills, I was able to help multiple small
            businesses in my area by creating beautiful websites and expanding
            their digital presence. While I started using website design
            programs like Wix, my interest in computers has pushed me towards
            learning languages like HTML, CSS to build custom websites like this
            one. I have also started learning the Python programming language to
            further challenge myself and develop foundational knowledge
            regarding application development. As I continue to develop my
            programming skills, study business, and expand my personal network,
            I am confident that I will be able to create a startup with the
            ability to positively impact the lives of many. While my business
            ambitions are clear, It is also important to discuss my personal
            past. I’m currently a 17-year-old based in Olympia, WA. During my
            early life, I was homeschooled rather than being sent to a public
            elementary school. Due to the flexibility that the homeschool
            curriculum offered, I was able to skip two grades before entering
            7th grade at a public middle school at the age of 11. While I
            continued to excel academically throughout my middle school
            experience, the age gap between me and my peers made me feel
            slightly isolated. However, as I progressed through high school, I
            learned that the differences between me and my peers helped me learn
            about individualism. Functioning independently helped me build my
            confidence and embrace my young age. After the COVID-19 pandemic
            forced schools to start teaching online, I decided to switch to a
            running start program at South Puget Sound Community College for my
            senior year. I graduated with the class of 2021 at the age of 16,
            which has led me to where I am now: a 17-year-old Sophomore at South
            Puget Sound Community College. This year, I plan to earn my
            Associates in Business before transferring to a four-year
            university. If you’ve read this far, thank you! I appreciate your
            interest in my personal journey and I encourage you to explore other
            parts of the website or get in touch with me!
