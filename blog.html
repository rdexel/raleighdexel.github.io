            <h2>08/30/21: Explaining my investment in Hedera Hashgraph</h2>
            <p>
              On my way home from a property photoshoot the other day, I decided
              to listen to a podcast called Crypto 101. I’ve been skeptical of
              crypto for the past couple of months, mostly because of the
              volatility and the worthless altcoins appearing on the market. But
              for some reason, my curiosity led me to listen to an interview
              with the founder of Hedera Hashgraph, Leemon Baird. Hedera
              Hashgraph is a new type of distributed ledger technology, which is
              basically a computer that exists among tons of different nodes on
              tons of different computers. The Hedera Hashgraph network, rather
              than being based on traditional blockchain technology, is based on
              a new type of consensus algorithm. It relies on nodes that gossip
              to each other and eventually come to a collective consensus about
              the validity and history of a transaction. While I won’t go super
              far into the details, this technology is absolutely revolutionary
              in terms of crypto. The Hashgraph network can handle upwards of
              10,000 transactions per second with a $0.01 transaction fee.
              Considering modern blockchain technologies like those employed by
              Bitcoin and Ethereum offer slow tps rates and astronomical gas
              fees, Hedera Hashgraph is on a completely different level. Due to
              the multiple corporations involved in the governance of Hedera
              Hashgraph (Google, IBM, Boeing, LG, Tata Communications, etc.),
              some argue that the Hedera network is not classified as a
              decentralized asset. However, this is simply irrelevant; Hedera’s
              goals have never been aligned with being a completely
              decentralized currency. Rather, Hedera aims to be a public utility
              that can be used by anybody. While it will take some time for
              people to accept that Hedera is not a typical DeFi currency,
              Hedera Hashgraph’s involvement with large companies and the sheer
              amount of projects happening on the network prove that it is on
              it’s way to mass adoption.
